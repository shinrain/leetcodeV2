public class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=1) return 1;

        int first = 1, second = 1;
        int re = -1;
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++)
        {
            re = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = re;
        }
        return re;
    }
