UniquePaths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

    	if(m*n==0) return 0;
    	int[] re = new int[n];

    		re[i] = 1;

    			else re[j]+=re[j-1];
    		}
